# Streaming-Data-ETL-Simulation

In this project I will be scraping data from a webservice and try to replicate the functionality of streaming tables in Databricks.

The flow of the project will be as follows:

* Identify a constant scrapable web source of data with enough columns and data to create an analysis.
* Define column information and dataset structure, iteration identifiers, and locations where data will be stored in the end.
* Create ETL pipelines to scrape, clean and transform and load/merge data with existing data while also retaining past information.
* In a new notebook/SQL Server, pull cleaned data and perform statistical analyses and EDA to detect and remove any outliers.  
* In a new notebook/PowerBI/Tableau (Haven't decided this one yet), create visuals to depict any emerging trends and visually report analyses.

 I intend to use Python - Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Matplotlib and Seaborn. The goal is to view Data Engineering and Data Analyses as "the industry" views them, two separate tasks that use aligning skills.
